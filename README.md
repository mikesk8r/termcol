# termcol
A simple and fast free-to-use cross-platform C++ library for colored text in the terminal.
Please note that this library is **not** supported on Windows, it is for \*nix systems **only**.

## How it works
termcol uses escape codes to change text colors. It also automatically changes the text back, so **no manually resetting the text color**!

## Usage
Include the header file in your project and start using it!
See **example usage** in `example.cpp`.
