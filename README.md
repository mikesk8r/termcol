# termcol
A simple and fast cross-platform C++ library for colored text in the terminal.

## How it works
termcol uses escape codes to change text colors. It also automatically changes the text back, so no manually resetting the text color!

## Usage
Include the header file in your project and start using it!
See example usage in `example.cpp`.
